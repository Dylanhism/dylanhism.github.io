            <h1>IMDb clone</h1>
            <p>During the beginning of 2021, I and one other wrote an IMDb clone which hosted a 2500 movie database through mongoDB that could be searched through by people that contributed to making movies, by genre of movies or by a movie's title.</p>

            <img id='movieEx' src='/images/imdb/moviePage.png' alt='Movie page example' title='Movie page example'>
            <p>All of the design through HTML and CSS was designed and implemented by myself.</p>
            <p>In creating the site, I put a lot of attention into ensuring the differences in screen sizes would not hinder the features of the website.</p>
            <p>As seen below, is an example of the home page which showcased featured movies that could be positioned dynamically depending on the device while not distorting the images.</p>
            <img id='movieDynamicEx' src='/images/imdb/resize.gif' alt='Example of dynamic resize design' title='Example of dynamic resize design'>
            <p>A main feature of this site was the allowance of user interaction.</p>
            <div id='profileContainer'>
                <img id='userPageEx' src='/images/imdb/userPage.png' alt='Example of user profile page' title='Example of user profile page'>
                
                <p>We had allowed users to create accounts or sign in which would then permit them to leave reviews on movies with ratings, follow other users, follow contributers of movies (actos, directors, writers), add movies to a 'watched' list and view their profile page.
                <br><br>By the user creating reviews of a score greater than or equal to 6, we decided to implement an algorithm to search for movies with similar genres to these reviews by collecting all genres from these reviews and randomly picking 5 genres from the list. This would
                    make a tailored search to a user as when they like multiple movies with the same genre, that genre will be more likely to be picked in the search, meaning a higher likelihood of them liking it.
