            <h1>IMDb clone</h1>
            <p>
                During the beginning of 2021, I and one other wrote an IMDb clone which featured logins, reviews, following of other users and people and more as described below.
            </p>
            <a id='movieEx'>
                <img src='/images/imdb/moviePage.png' alt='Movie page example' title='Movie page example'>
            </a>
            <p>
                All of the design through HTML and CSS was designed and implemented by myself.
                <br> In creating the site, I put a lot of attention into ensuring the differences in screen sizes would not hinder the features of the website.
                <br> As seen below, is an example of the home page which showcased featured movies that could be positioned dynamically depending on the device while not distorting the images.
