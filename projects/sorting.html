            <p>This was a small project that tought me some basics about JavaScript and manipulating the DOM.
                Having to keep track of which items were selected to toggle highlighting and ordering items
                when the are inserted made me think about how items in a list would be indexed to be able to 
                access them later (highlight them in this case).

            <p>This project also tought me some basics about CSS and HTML as this was an early project in my web development
                learning. These skills and knowledge would come in handy for later projects and help me learn more
                about more complex JavaScript or technologies by taking less time to create a design that would
                utilize the logic fully.
