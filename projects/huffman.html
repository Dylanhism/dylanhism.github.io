        <h1>Huffman Tree File Compression</h1>
        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>During my studies, one project I worked on with two others was creating a program in python to compress
                .bmp, .txt, .mp4 and .wav files and uncompress them without any data loss (lossless compression).
            </p>

        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>We created the program in Python 3 using our knowledge of binary trees to construct a program that used the
                Huffman Tree compression technique. It worked by taking all bytes in the file and making a dictionary of the
                most frequent bytes and ordering them accordingly. Then, with this dictionary, the program could make linear
                lookups by the bytes and construct a binary tree where more frequent bytes are higher up in the tree and
                less frequent bytes are lower down. Each traversal in the tree corresponded to a zero for going left and
                a one for going right, creating binary encodings for each byte more efficiently.
            </p>

        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>Above is the compression in action with some numbers showing how fast the compression is completed. It takes
                the forest or man picture above and turns it into a smaller file. There is a limit to this compression as 
                you might have noticed for the forest file which is not smaller (defeating the purpose). This is due
                potentially to the fact that Huffman Tree compression is not a completely efficient compression algorithm
                and could also be due to the fact that the file is already quite small where large images would benefit more.
