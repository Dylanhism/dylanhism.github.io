            <p>Space Invaders, a classic game!
            </p>
            <p>During highschool, myself and two others remade space invaders using
                Python 2 with a package called 'Pygame'. Using our combined efforts, 
                we created every sprite in the game that would look like the original
                and create our own animations.
            </p>

        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>The game, like the original had breakable barriers, aliens worth different
                amounts of points, a life system and most importantly, moving shooting
                enemies. Once the aliens got far down enough, they speed up making the
                game more intense. If you killed all the aliens, the game automatically
                starts up a new round with an extra life for you and your score
                carrying over.
            </p>

            <p>This project at the time tought me a lot about Python, basic animations,
                timings and framerates and thinking about how data in programs would
                be represented appropriately and useful.
