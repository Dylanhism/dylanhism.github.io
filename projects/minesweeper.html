        <h1>Minesweeper</h1>
        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>Using Python 2 and Pygame, I recreated the classic game Minesweeper with one other to develop our skills
                in Python programming and understanding of functions better.</p>

        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>This game like the original, ours featured input through mouse clicks and dealing with the correct square to
                uncover from the grid depending on the click. Knowing this, we decided to store the grid in a series of arrays
                that is built up initially by selecting the bomb positions randomly. Then we populating the other tiles with the
                correct numbers depending on surrounding bombs. Getting the mouse position and using basic arithmatic to divide
                by the tile size allowed me to have constant lookups when finding the number/bomb underneith it.

        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>We also implemented the choice of difficulties which add more tiles to the game and more bombs to avoid. To
                implement this, we seperated the game modes into different functions to make rendering them and working with
                the code easier and cleaner to read.
