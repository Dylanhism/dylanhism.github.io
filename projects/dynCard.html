        <h1>Dynamic Card Viewer</h1>
        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>In this short project I learned about the use of Pug.js, a template engine which
                allowed me to create dynamic HTML pages depending on the data that is fed into it.
                I also moved to start using Express.js which helped streamline Node.js funtionality
                into a more convenient format as I had a good understanding of Node.js at this point.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img id='compEx2' src='/images/dynCard/cardMain.png' alt='Main page showing all card names' title='Main page showing all card names'>
        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>This project could load an array from a .JSON file which contained all the information
                needed about the card. Using this array information, the Pug template takes it's name
                and id on the main page and renders them all reducing the time to manually write it
                and the duplication of names or information in two places.
            </p>
            <p>Learning to create HTML with Pug.js later helped me to create pages in my main project
                "IMDb clone" by allowing me to render movie pages with different data using the same
                structure which was necessary to support a great number of films.
            </p>
        </div>
        <img id='compEx2' src='/images/dynCard/cardSingle.png'>
        <div class='restrained'>
            <p>Above is an example of what each card would look like if you went to it's page. The rest
                of the data about the card would be loaded at this time into a different template to 
                render it like shown. This made the main page a lot cleaner as there wasn't an abundance
                of information being dumped onto the screen and made loading the page a bit faster with
                less data to load.
